<h3>About the PDChecker</h3>
<p>We built PDChecker after seeing too many noticios advertising "Dream Act Relief", trying to trick our community members into paying thousands of dollars for legal services that wouldn't lead anywhere. This site will let you check whether you might be eligible for Prosecutorial Discretion; if you need help getting your GED or non-immigration legal advice, we can help you too.</p>

<p>The eligibility checker is based off of the one created by Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (<a href="http://icirr.org">ICIRR.org</a>). The GED classes we list are all funded by the government, so are legit. In the coming months we'll be checking with each program individually - in the meantime, if you had a negative or positive experience with any GED program, <a href="contact.html">let us know!</a></p>

<p>We (Rebecca and Rigo) are part of the Immigrant Youth Justice League. IYJL is a Chicago-based organization led by undocumented youth working towards full recognition of the rights and contributions of all immigrants through education, leadership development, policy advocacy, resource gathering, and mobilization. Since we became an organization in October 2009 we attempt to do our organizing and live our lives undocumented, unafraid, and unapologetic. You can learn more about us at <a href="http://www.iyjl.org/">IYJL.org</a>.</p>

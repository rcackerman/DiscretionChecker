<h2>Information for Undocumented Youth</h2>

<h3>Local Information</h3>
<p>Whether or not you're eligible for Prosecutorial Discretion, you can still make a huge difference! There are several organizations in Detroit and Michigan working on immigrant rights. Because Prosecutorial Discretion is just temporary, and not a law, it's especially important that we keep organizing in our communities.</p>
<p>1Michigan works for all immigrant youth. Connect with them on Twitter: <a href="http://twitter.com/onemichigan">@onemichigan</a>. They're doing a ton of PD workshops, too.</p>
<p><a href="http://michiganimmigrationreform.org/">Alliance for Immigrants' Rights</a> is a coalition of immigrant rights groups in Michigan.</p>


<h3>National Information</h3>
<p>The new Obama Administration deferred action initiative will allow undocumented youths to receive protection from deportation for a two year period and apply for a work permit.  Both the deferred action and the work permit will be renewable.  Deferred action does not confer lawfol permanent resident status (green card status) or put the immigrant on track for US citizenship.</p>
<p> To qualify for deferred action, applicants must</p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>have come to the US before they turned 16;</li>
<li>not be above the age of 30 and (for youths not in deportation) must be 15 or older;</li>

</ol>
